<h1>The Best Movies According to Oleksandr</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sherlock</h3>
<p>
A brilliantly written and well-acted series. Cumberbatch is a fantastic choice for
Sherlock Holmes - he nailed the role. The story had me hooked from the start to the very end.
Watched it more than five times and probably will do more. Highly recommend!

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
    Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made! 
</p>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>
    Heartwarming Holiday family classic.
